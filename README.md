This is the clone of the homepage of an awwwarded website - cynthiaugwu.com

This website's major part is the Image following animation whenever the mouse hovers over the headings and the images rotate in whichever direction the mouse goes!
It has a dedicated mouse follower circle which follows the mouse entirely on the screen and its major part is the skew effect of the circle.
Skew effect here is when the mouse moves in a fast speed, the circle tends to flatten in that particular direction while following the mouse itself!
This website also uses locomotive scroll to implement smooth scrolling and gives the website an overall premium experience!
